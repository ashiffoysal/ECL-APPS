    					<p>Exam Centre London is now a registered UCAS centre, providing support for private candidates and
home educated students to access higher education. Our central objective is to ensure that each
candidate receives the help and assistance required to face the barriers and access the best
educational routes without difficulty! We strive to ease this procedure for you and make the
transition to higher education as smooth as possible!
UCAS (the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) is an institution providing assistance with
applying to British universities. Most universities in Britain would require students to register their
interest via UCAS and Exam Centre London is now able to offer this to our candidates. As a UCAS
registered centre, Exam Centre London will not only help its students to successfully complete the
entire application process but we will also have unique access to the student’s application to track it
during the process itself. Exam Centre London can review your application and suggest amendments
based on our valuable experience that we have accumulated over the years! Our experienced and
qualified advisors will be able to guide you towards the right direction, suggesting the best five
options for yourself!
Whilst candidates have the choice to apply independently, there are many benefits of linking your
application with Exam Centre London. We are proud to share that Exam Centre London will now
have access to:
