    					<p>Exam Centre London works in conjunction with Merit Tutors to offer GCSE practical exams for Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Sessions are held in fully equipped science labs in within the borough of Newham and supervised by highly qualified and competent science tutors. Practice sessions prior to the examination will equip candidates to accurately, confidently and safely manage equipment and conduct experiments.</p>

    					<p>Sessions are held in local state schools during the spring half term to ensure that candidates can maximise the use of labs without being disturbed. Detailed risk assessments are completed to ensure labs and equipment are safe to use.</p>

    					<p>Practice practical sessions are led by one member of staff and up to ten candidates giving learners opportunity to familiarise themselves with the lab and equipment. Tutors will demonstrate core practical skills with chance for learners to ask questions before conducting their own individual practical experiments individually. Tutors provide tailored feedback across the sessions on how to improve and maximise grades.</p>
    					<p>The two-day practical course culminates with a final session in which candidates demonstrate their learning under assessed conditions. Details of fees for our GCSE Practical Assessments course can be accessed here.</p>
